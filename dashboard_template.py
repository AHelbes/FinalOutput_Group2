    The **Video Game Sales** dataset was formulated by Gregory Smith in 2016, it is generally focused on presenting varying data that encompasses multiple sales figures of various video game titles, with the video games included having a minimum cap of atleast generating 100,000 sales of individual copies.

    In general, the dataset contains 11 columns that have their own distinct attributes, but these columns can be seperated into two primary categories which are the descriptive and numerical columns. Descriptive columns involve data such as ranking, name, platform, year genre, and publisher. The other column comprising of numerical data consist of data such as the different sales figures for regions such as North America, Europe, Japan, Other coupled countries, and a Global collection.

    **Content**      
    The dataset as a whole contains 16,598 rows, as originally 2 additional rows were present but the creator of the dataset itself has removed these rows due to too many incomplete information being present within them. There are varying columns that help to seperate the rows distinctinctly which are mainly divided into two categories which are mentioned above. In addition the sales figures of the dataset are in millions in that (1 is equivalent to 1,000,000 sales).

    The results from `df.describe()` mainly shows the descriptive statistics about the dataset. The main highlights are the key trends in game releases and regional sales patterns:

    **Release Year**: Games in this dataset average a release year of 2006, with a standard deviation of 5.83, spanning from 1980 to 2020. The concentration around the 2000s and 2010s (as shown by the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles: 2003, 2007, and 2010) reflects an emphasis on more recent titles.

    Sales by Region:
    - **NA_Sales**: The North American market averages 0.26 million units per game, with high variability (standard deviation of 0.82) and a maximum of 41.49 million units, underscoring a strong demand for blockbuster games.
    - **EU_Sales**: European sales average 0.15 million units with a standard deviation of 0.51, typically lower than in North America but still showing steady performance.
    - **JP_Sales**: Japan shows an average of 0.08 million units (standard deviation of 0.31), indicating it as a smaller, more niche market.
    - **Other_Sales**: Other regions average 0.08 million units with a standard deviation of 0.19. However, a few games reach up to 10.22 million units in these markets.

    **Global Sales**: Aggregating all regions, the average global sales per game reach 0.54 million units, with a high standard deviation of 1.56. The top-selling game hit 82.74 million units, reflecting a skewed distribution where only a few titles achieve high global sales.
                
    The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles across all sales regions illustrate a skewed distribution, with the majority of games falling into lower sales brackets and only a few achieving high sales. This distribution suggests the dataset‚Äôs usefulness for studying sales patterns and factors that contribute to high-performing games across different markets and release periods. summarize
